# Introduction

# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

# 

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

## Similarities:

- Both techniques relied on failure times and aimed to determine the target failure rate (MTTF).
- Both techniques utilized the same dataset of failures as input.
- Both techniques evaluated the same system.

## Differences:

The techniques generated distinct reliability plots as they analyzed the data differently.
Reliability growth analysis employed both failure count and inter-failure times, whereas RDC solely focused on inter-failure times.
