By analyzing the table, we can observe that the log-likelihood, essentially a test for comparing two models, emphasizes the improvement in terms of likelihood value. From the log-likelihood values, we were able to deduce that the S(E,F,C) and DW2(E,F,C) were the two models that most closely matched our failure data set. S(E,F,C) represents S distribution model, while DW2 stands for Discrete Weibull (Type II).

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

## Similarities:

- Both techniques relied on failure times and aimed to determine the target failure rate (MTTF).
- Both techniques utilized the same dataset of failures as input.
- Both techniques evaluated the same system.

## Differences:

- The techniques generated distinct reliability plots as they analyzed the data differently.
- Reliability growth analysis employed both failure count and inter-failure times
- RDC solely focused on inter-failure times.
